# Optimizing Olay Campaings

During my internship with Saatchi & Saatchi X, a renowned marketing agency within the Publicis Group, I spearheaded a comprehensive analysis focused on optimizing Olay's marketing campaigns. Utilizing R, dyplr, lmtest, and MASS, I delved into Olay's extensive dataset covering Fiscal Year 2022.

The project commenced with meticulous data cleansing and preparation processes, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of our analyses. Leveraging R and dyplr, I executed a series of transformations and manipulations to wrangle the dataset into a usable format.

Through rigorous analysis, I uncovered significant insights that could drive strategic decisions for Olay's future campaigns. Notably, I discovered that investments in Pinterest platforms yielded a remarkable 20 percent increase in return on investment (ROI). This finding highlighted the effectiveness of Pinterest as a marketing channel for Olay and underscored the importance of allocating resources accordingly in future campaigns.

As per the confidentiality agreement with the company, I am unable to share detailed project findings beyond what's presented in the provided PowerPoint presentation. However, the presentation encapsulates key insights, methodologies, and results in a digestible format.

Please find the attached PowerPoint presentation, which provides an overview of the project scope, methodology, and notable findings. If you have any further questions or require additional information, please feel free to reach out.
